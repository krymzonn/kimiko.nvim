# kimiko.nvim

Neovim port of my old vim colorscheme

This shall be expanded upon.


## Thanks and attributions

This port got a nice starting boost from
[Taha's Themery](https://github.com/tahayvr/themery.nvim)
which helped massively to find my way around
neovim plugin-craft. While it seems eventually none of that
code has stayed, it was and is a great starting point.

IIRC some original inspirations to the old vim theme
were `koehler` and `miko`. Had gruvbox been already invented,
I might have used it, instead of writing my own.

Thanks to documentation writers and LLMs for great help
getting to understand how neovim plugins work at all.

I still have a lot to learn. Suggestions and contributions most welcome
